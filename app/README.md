# Popular Movies 2 created by Kirit Bhatt for the Udacity's Android developer Nanodegree Program

Popular Movies (Stage 1) App is the second project for current Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree program.

Build a simple movies app that communicates with the internet and provides a responsive user experience. 

In this project, you’ll fetch data from the Internet with the MovieDB API, use adapters and custom list layouts
to populate list views, and incorporate libraries to simplify your code.

Popular Movies, Stage 2, is the third project for the current Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree program.

Expand on the movies app you built in Project 1 to create a fully-featured app. 
In this project, you’ll allow users to view and play trailers, read reviews, and mark their favorite movies. 
You’ll also create a database and content provider to store and handle your app data.


## Used libraries
- Butter Knife
- Image Library Picasso
+ plus many more, some of the libraries used are outdated, however, started to use those libraries for Stage 1 so I continued to use the same.

## How to use
You are going to need an API Key to use this app. To get an API Key, Go to www.themoviedb.org and sign up. 
Edit the Utilities/NetworkUtiles.java file. There is an **apiKey** variable. Replace the string with your own api key.
